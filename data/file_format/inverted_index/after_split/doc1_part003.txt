A consequence of the file locking strategy is that AFS does not support large shared databases or record updating within files shared between client systems. This was a deliberate design decision based on the perceived needs of the university computing environment. It leads, for example, to the use of a single file per message in the original email system for the Andrew Project, the Andrew Message System, rather than a single file per mailbox. See AFS and buffered I/O Problems for handling shared databases.
